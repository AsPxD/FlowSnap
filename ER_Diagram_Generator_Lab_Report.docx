1. Abstract
The FlowSnap is a sophisticated Java-based tool designed for software engineers, database designers, and system analysts that automatically transforms SQL CREATE TABLE statements into interactive, visually appealing Entity-Relationship diagrams. Built on a robust JavaFX framework, this application bridges the gap between technical database specifications and intuitive visual representations. The software also incorporates Data Flow Diagram (DFD) capabilities, providing users with a comprehensive toolset for visualizing both database structures and system data flows in a single, unified interface. With features like automatic relationship detection, interactive diagram manipulation, and high-quality image export functionality, the FlowSnap significantly streamlines the database documentation process while enhancing communication between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

2. Introduction
In modern software development and database design, effective communication of complex data structures is paramount to project success. Traditional database design processes often create a disconnect between technical implementations (SQL scripts) and conceptual understanding, particularly for stakeholders without SQL expertise. This disconnect frequently leads to miscommunication, implementation errors, and project delays.

The FlowSnap addresses these challenges by providing:
• Automatic conversion of technical SQL definitions into standardized visual diagrams
• Interactive capabilities that allow real-time manipulation for optimal presentation
• Integrated tools for both structural (ER) and behavioral (DFD) modeling
• Export functionality for documentation and presentation purposes

By combining these capabilities in a single application, the FlowSnap serves as a comprehensive visualization tool that significantly enhances communication among development teams, database administrators, business analysts, and other stakeholders throughout the software development lifecycle.

3. Problem Statement
